# GenericNetworkLayer
This is a lightweight Swift network layer using URLSession for making HTTP requests.
It simplifies common networking tasks and handles basic error scenarios.
To use, simply integrate an endpoint according to the API you are working with and create a mid service class with the endpoint. 
You can use samples in the code as a base.
